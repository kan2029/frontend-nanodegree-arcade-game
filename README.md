===============================

About the game:
Your goal is to cross the path full of enemy bugs and reach the water body. You will have to evade the bugs in order to do so. If you collide with any bug, the game will reset and you will be brought back to the starting point.

How to start the game:
Open index.html and the game will start.

How to play the game:
1. You will start from your initial position which is at the bottom of the screen.
2. You can go in 4 directions using directional arrows (up, down, left, right).
3. By pressing a directional button, you will be able to move one block in that specific direction.
4. You are not allowed to cross the game borders.
5. Cross the path and reach the water body as many times as possible without failing. The streak counter below the game shows your winning streak.

See if you can beat your friend's score. :)

Additional functionalities included:
1. Player's character can be changed. I have used modal window to display all characters. User can select any character and start playing
2. Winning streak is included as well. It will be incremented by 1 as user wins, but will get reset to 0 as the player collides with any bug.
