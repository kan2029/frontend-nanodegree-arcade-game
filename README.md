===============================

Open index.html and the game will start.

Additional functionalities included:

1. Player's character can be changed. I have used modal window to display all characters. User can select any character and start playing
2. Winning streak is included as well. It will be incremented by 1 as user wins, but will get reset to 0 as the player collides with any bug.


Rest of the functionality is maintained.
